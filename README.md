# Drupal 6 Doxygen Generated Documentation

This package provides everything Doxygen needs to generate API documentation for Drupal.

## Generating Documentation

Generating API documentation for Drupal is easy with these quick steps.

  * From the command link execute `doxygen drupal.doxy`. This will generate the documentation andput it in the new directory docs/html.
  * Open up your browser to docs/html/index.html

It's that simple.

## Custom Configs

Doxygen has a lot of configuration options. The ones chosen here are to my preference but you may want something different.

For more details on how to configure Doxygen you can read the commends in the config file or the [Online Documentation](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/config.html)
